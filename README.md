# CrowdEd *(Working Title)*
Location-based collaborative learning web-app.

## Vision:

At CrowdEd we believe everyone can be both a teacher and a student in their lifelong learning journey. 

- CrowdEd aims to unlock opportunities to learn, and teach, in your everyday life.  
- CrowdEd aims to leverage on high-density living and the power of community-based peer-teaching.  
- CrowdEd invites you to ask *"What can you learn from those around you?"* instead of *"What do you want to learn, and where can you learn it?"*

Learning new skills need not be limited to courses that are high-commitment, expensive, and curriculum- or block-based. 

Users will be able to:

1. Offer to teach others skills by:
   - listing skills that they possess.
   - listing the level of proficiency in skills.
   - providing a primary location / neighbourhood.
   
2. Learn skills from others by:
    - viewing listed skills, and teachers, near their primary location.
    - intiate a conversation with other users.
    - offer to teach a skill in exchange.
    - make a booking.
